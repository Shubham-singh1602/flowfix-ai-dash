# AI Traffic Control Dashboard

An advanced web-based interactive traffic control dashboard that simulates real-time traffic monitoring and signal management for urban intersections. Built with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies.

## üö¶ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Interactive Traffic Map**: Visual representation of intersections with color-coded congestion levels
- **Real-time Simulation**: Dynamic traffic data updates with vehicle counts and average speeds
- **Traffic Signal Control**: Automated and manual traffic light management
- **Live Analytics**: Real-time charts showing traffic volume and speed trends
- **Alert System**: Intelligent notifications for congestion and traffic anomalies
- **Scenario Management**: Multiple traffic scenarios (Morning Peak, Evening Rush, Accident Simulation)

### Smart Controls
- **Simulation Parameters**: Adjustable vehicle density and speed factors
- **Emergency Priority**: Toggle for emergency vehicle prioritization
- **Auto/Manual Modes**: Switch between automated AI control and manual signal management
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live monitoring of total vehicles, average speeds, and congestion levels

### Professional UI
- **Modern Dashboard**: Dark theme with electric blue accents for control center aesthetics
- **Smooth Animations**: Traffic light transitions, vehicle movements, and data updates
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, click interactions, and visual feedback

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

Built with modern web technologies:
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state management

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Start Simulation**: Click the "Start Simulation" button to begin traffic monitoring
2. **Select Scenarios**: Choose from different traffic patterns (Morning Peak, Evening Rush, etc.)
3. **Adjust Parameters**: Use sliders to modify vehicle density and speed factors
4. **Monitor Intersections**: Click on intersection markers to view detailed statistics
5. **Control Signals**: Switch to manual mode to manually control traffic lights
6. **View Analytics**: Monitor real-time charts showing traffic trends
